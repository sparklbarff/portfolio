# Anthropic API Key Test Commands

## ðŸ§ª Test Your New API Key

Once you've set up your Anthropic API key in Cline, try these commands to test the integration:

### **Test 1: Project Analysis**
```
Cline, analyze my CRT/VHS portfolio structure and give me a detailed overview of:
1. All JavaScript effects files
2. CSS animation systems  
3. HTML structure
4. Development server setup
5. Three immediate improvement suggestions
```

### **Test 2: Code Understanding**
```
Cline, examine my crt-effects.js file and explain:
1. How the phosphor glow system works
2. The timing mechanisms used
3. Performance optimization opportunities
4. Browser compatibility considerations
```

### **Test 3: Task Execution**
```
Cline, create a backup of my current effects system, then experiment with:
1. Increasing VHS tracking line subtlety by 25%
2. Adding a gentle screen flicker every 8 seconds
3. Testing changes with live server
4. Show me before/after comparison
```

### **Test 4: Research & Implementation**
```
Cline, research modern CSS techniques for realistic CRT scanlines, then:
1. Implement the best technique in my system
2. Integrate it with existing effects
3. Optimize for 60fps performance
4. Add toggle controls for the effect
```
