## Questions for Final Planning

1. **Image Organization:** Should images tell a story/journey or remain random rotation?

2. **Audio Integration:** Are tracks ambient background or specific to certain images?

3. **Information Display:** Add titles/descriptions overlay or keep minimal aesthetic?

4. **Mobile Experience:** Any specific mobile gallery enhancements needed?

5. **Future Content:** Plan for adding new images/audio to existing system?
