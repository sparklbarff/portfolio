```

## 🔧 DOCKER CONFIGURATION DETAILS

### **Development Container (Dockerfile):**
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
# Security: Non-root user 'portfolio'
# Ports: 3001 (dev), 9229 (debug)
# Health checks included
```

### **Multi-Service Setup (docker-compose.yml):**
```yaml
services:
  portfolio-dev:    # Development server
    ports: ["3001:3001", "9229:9229"]
    volumes: [hot reload enabled]
  
  nginx:           # Production testing
    ports: ["8080:80"]
    profiles: ["production-test"]
```

### **Package.json Scripts Added:**
```json
"docker:build": "docker build -t portfolio-dev .",
"docker:dev": "docker-compose up portfolio-dev",
"docker:prod-test": "docker-compose --profile production-test up",
"docker:stop": "docker-compose down",
"docker:clean": "docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans && docker system prune -f"
```

## 🎛️ CURRENT STATUS

### **What's Working:**
- ✅ **Docker Desktop**: Running with Microsoft dev container
- ✅ **Development Environment**: User is in containerized VS Code
- ✅ **Portfolio Server**: Running on http://localhost:3002 (avoiding port conflict)
- ✅ **AI Tools**: Cline, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex available
- ✅ **Hot Reload**: File changes reflect immediately

### **Port Allocation:**
- **3001**: Cline's server (AI assistant)
- **3002**: Portfolio development server (current)
- **8080**: Nginx production test (available)

### **What's Configured But Not Yet Used:**
- Docker Compose multi-service setup
- Production testing with Nginx
- Automated setup scripts (ready for local use)

## 🚀 LEARNING PROGRESSION SUGGESTED

### **Phase 1: Docker Fundamentals**
Explain core concepts the user should understand:
- What containers are vs virtual machines
- Images vs containers
- Dockerfiles vs docker-compose
- Volumes and networking basics
- Docker Desktop interface navigation

### **Phase 2: Understanding Their Setup**
Help them understand what they currently have:
- How dev containers work in VS Code
- Why they have Microsoft's Node.js image
- How their portfolio files are mounted/accessible
- Port forwarding and networking

### **Phase 3: Practical Usage**
Guide them through using their configured setup:
- Running docker-compose commands
- Understanding build vs run
- Managing containers and images
- Using Docker Desktop interface

### **Phase 4: Advanced Workflows**
More sophisticated usage patterns:
- Multi-stage builds
- Development vs production containers
- CI/CD integration possibilities
- Performance optimization

## 💡 SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS

### **User's Context Questions:**
1. "How does Docker Desktop relate to what I'm seeing?"
2. "What's the difference between the Microsoft image I have and the Dockerfile we created?"
3. "Why do I need both docker-compose and Dockerfile?"
4. "How do I use the setup scripts we created?"
5. "What are the practical benefits for my portfolio development?"

### **Practical Learning:**
1. "Show me how to use Docker Desktop interface"
2. "Walk me through building and running containers"
3. "How do I troubleshoot common Docker issues?"
4. "What are best practices I should follow?"
