# CRT/VHS Portfolio Project Handoff

## Project Overview
I'm building an authentic CRT/VHS simulation portfolio website with realistic physics-based effects. The project simulates actual CRT monitor behavior including NTSC timing, P22 phosphor persistence, thermal drift, and RGB convergence errors.

## What's Been Completed âœ…

### Core Systems Architecture
- **CRTResource.js**: Memory management and cleanup system
- **CRTConfig.js**: Centralized configuration with physics parameters
- **CRTSystem.js**: Unified state management and effect coordination
- **crt-physics-enhanced.js**: NEW - Authentic CRT physics engine with:
  - NTSC scan timing (15.734kHz horizontal, 59.94Hz vertical)
  - P22 phosphor simulation (R:1ms, G:2ms, B:10ms persistence)
  - Temperature modeling (22Â°C â†’ 65Â°C warmup with drift)
  - RGB convergence error calculation
  - WebGL particle system with CSS fallbacks

### Visual Effects (Enhanced with Physics)
- **title-glitch.js**: Physics-integrated phosphor trails and convergence
- **nav-glitch.js**: Enhanced with thermal effects and convergence errors
- **performance-monitor.js**: Device capability detection
- **crt-effects.js**: Ambient CRT artifacts
- **bg-loader.js**: Background cycling with brightness analysis
- **mini-windows.js**: Modal content system

### Test Infrastructure
- **test.html**: Real-time physics monitoring page
- Live thermal state, convergence errors, scan position display
- System status verification

## Current Status âœ…

The enhanced CRT physics system has been successfully implemented and integrated with all visual effects! Task 1.4 from Enhancement_Plan.md has been completed:

### âœ… Completed Integrations:
1. **Enhanced Phosphor Simulation**: Connected authentic P22 phosphor physics to title-glitch.js with temperature-based color shifting
2. **Advanced Convergence Errors**: Enhanced nav-glitch.js with thermal, magnetic, and scan-position based convergence effects
3. **Physics Coordination**: Updated CRT effects system with comprehensive physics integration
4. **Temperature Color Shifting**: Implemented dynamic color temperature adjustment based on thermal state
5. **Magnetic Field Effects**: Added cursor proximity-based magnetic distortion to navigation
6. **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Verified webkit prefixes and fallback systems

### ðŸŽ¯ What's Working:
- **Real-time Physics**: 60Hz NTSC scan timing with P22 phosphor persistence
- **Thermal Effects**: Temperature-based color shifting and convergence drift
- **Magnetic Distortion**: Cursor proximity affects navigation convergence
- **Adaptive Quality**: Performance-based particle count scaling (1000â†’50 particles)
- **Memory Management**: Efficient particle pooling and cleanup systems
