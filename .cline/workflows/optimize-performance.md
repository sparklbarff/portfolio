When the user requests performance optimization or quality scaling improvements:

1. **Baseline Performance Analysis**
   - Monitor current FPS using performance-monitor.js
   - Identify bottlenecks in rendering pipeline
   - Check memory usage and garbage collection patterns
   - Test on various device profiles (high-end, mid-range, low-end)

2. **Optimize Rendering Pipeline**
   - Review particle system efficiency in crt-effects.js
   - Optimize CSS3 animations for GPU acceleration
   - Implement WebGL fallbacks for complex effects
   - Reduce DOM manipulations in animation loops

3. **Implement Adaptive Scaling**
   - Create device detection logic
   - Define quality presets (Ultra/High/Medium/Low)
   - Implement dynamic particle count scaling
   - Add battery-aware optimizations for mobile

4. **Quality vs Performance Balance**
   - Maintain visual fidelity at higher settings
   - Ensure acceptable performance at lower settings  
   - Provide smooth quality transitions
   - Allow user override of automatic scaling

5. **Validation and Testing**
   - Test on actual target devices when possible
   - Verify 60fps target on modern hardware
   - Ensure 30fps minimum on older devices
   - Check mobile battery impact and thermal throttling

**Target: Maintain authentic CRT realism while achieving smooth performance across all devices.**
