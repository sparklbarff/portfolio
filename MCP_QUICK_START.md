Hey Cline! I'm new to MCP integration. Can you:

1. Give me a tour of my CRT/VHS portfolio project
2. Show me what files you can see
3. Explain how you can help with my development workflow
4. Start my development servers (ports 3000, 3001, 5500)

My project is a retro CRT/VHS portfolio with JavaScript effects and I want to learn how you can help me improve it.
```

### Step 3: Watch the Magic
Cline will:
- âœ… Scan your entire project structure
- âœ… Understand your CRT/VHS system architecture  
- âœ… Start your live development servers
- âœ… Open your portfolio in the browser

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Commands to Try

## ðŸ”¥ Pro Tips

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "make it better" â†’ "increase phosphor glow by 20%"
2. **Ask for explanations**: "Explain what you're changing as you work"
3. **Use for learning**: "Teach me how the CRT retrace timing works"
4. **Set up workflows**: "Create my daily development startup routine"

## ðŸš¨ If Something Goes Wrong

**Cline isn't responding?**
